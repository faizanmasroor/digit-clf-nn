# NOTE:
This program is currently broken, as training parameters have not been optimized yet and the mechanism for taking user input of a 28 x 28 digit has not been implemented.

# Purpose:
This program is a sequential neural network that uses the PyTorch framework to classify 28 x 28 digits (0 through 9) and is trained by the MNIST dataset.
